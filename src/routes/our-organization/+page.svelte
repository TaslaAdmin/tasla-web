          TASLA was launched back in 2015 as a scholarship named the Computer Science Leaders (CSLeaders) Scholarship. It was initiated by the Nithya Bhaskara Widya non-profit organization as a legal identity. CSLeaders is a scholarship program for computer science undergraduate students to develop themselves to be future leaders and help change the world, now rebranded as TASLA to broaden our reach not only for computer science students, but also for STEM students.

        <p class="text-white text-base md:text-xl text-justify font-primary py-5">
          TASLA is built within the concern of the lack of digital talents of Indonesia. It is under-supplied of 9 million digital talents. One of the main reason of the phenomena, is the lack of leadership in tech industries. Thus, the birth of one of the main TASLAâ€™s principles: viral leadership. We believe we can grow leadership by nurturing tech-savvy local leaders. By doing so, they can create ripple effects in the digital economy and help others be leaders. Hence, solving the lack of digital talents of Indonesia.

        <p class="text-white text-base md:text-xl text-justify font-primary py-5">
          We believe that good leaders are nurtured by systematic exposure to mentorship, work and leadership training. This is the main idea of the 4 programs that is maintained in TASLA scholarship. Those 4 programs, are spesifically built for teaching 3 crucial part of leaders: viral leadership, exposure and recognition, and capacity building. With that, the individuals should be ready to be leaders across any field they going to work on.

        <p class="text-white text-base md:text-xl text-justify font-primary py-5">
          The program structure is designed for the scholars itself to maintain. Yes, if you are the chosen as the scholars, you are expected to run the whole scheme of the program while also being the one who should obtain the benefit of this. This is meant so that the scholars can also learn leadership while teaching themself how to do that, starting with a relatively small scale: the scholarship program structure.
